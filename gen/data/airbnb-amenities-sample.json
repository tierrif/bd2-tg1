We have two children, a 7 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We have been living in Amsterdam for 20 years and love the city! We enjoy the relaxed vibe and the fact that the city is so compact: One can walk or bike anywhere. \r\n\r\nWe are first time airbnb renters, but have done several home exchanges over the last years, all very successful. \r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to host you in our lovely house!",

        "host_about": "I was born in Athens, Greece in 1968. I studied French Literature in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and History of Art in Sorbonne University. I speak Greek, English, French, Italian and Spanish. I like traveling a lot, I have been in a lot of places... England, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, Thailand, Phuket, Indonesia, Bali, Kenya, Dubai, Bahrain... I have worked as interpreter and translator, conferences organizer, personal assistant to Managing Directors and my last job was as chief editor in Economist Intelligent Life magazine for Greece. In 2013 I founded with my husband a Trading Company of Greek Standardized Food Products, wishing to promote our unique products all over the world. I am also the cultural editor in (URL HIDDEN) an on-line photographic magazine. I like swimming, exercising, hearing music, reading, painting, watching movies, traveling, being with my friends. My house is full of paintings and souvenirs from my trips all over the world. I love my beautiful husband, Thanos, my family, my niece, my friends, the interesting company of new acquaintances. I believe in 'carpe diem', which means 'seize the day', a life motto which I have painted in my body. We have no children and we live a beautiful life with our friends.",

The difference between those two is that a traveler doesn\u2019t need to go with the mass but to explore himself. In order to do so, he needs to know that before the exploration and afterwards, there will always be a spotless house to rest, with warm bed, soft fresh linens and a comfortable kitchen. What a traveler needs is a home away from home.\r\nBy offering my places through airbnb I put my own delight in a first place. In each traveler I see myself when being abroad and think what was that missing from my own trips. For this reason, I decorated all of my places on my own and I was thrilled about the future guests. This satisfaction makes the hosting experience a hobby, and never a job.\r\n   It is a great honor for me to receive your enjoyment when staying at my apartment. You are always welcome!",

        "interaction": "If you're someone who likes to keep to yourself, you'll have all the privacy you want in your room. The house is often pretty quiet during the week and we tend to keep busy, so minimal interaction with us is absolutely fine. We keep the common areas clean, and we're always respectful of our guests and their personal space. If you're into a more social atmosphere, that's cool too. Some weeks are quieter than others, but you're certainly welcome to join in on anything we end up doing while your'e in town. We also sometimes have people over for dinner, movies, backyard bonfires, and other gatherings. We want to make sure that those who stay with us feel comfortable and welcome, so if there's anything you need, just ask! We're happy to answer any questions or recommend things for you to do!",
        "host_about": "I like gardening, cooking, reading, being outdoors, working on various crafty endeavors, and taking advantage of all the amazing events and live music in our city. I've been in Austin my whole life and I can't seem to leave. That said, I love to travel and I've spent time in many different places around the world. I work as a freelance educational writer and spend most of my time during the week working in the office room of our house or at a coffee shop nearby. I'm the one who manages our Airbnb listing, but I live with my partner, Miguel, and Catbus, an orange cat who adopted us a few years ago. Miguel works at a Mediterranean cafe, and also does screen printing, carpentry, and landscaping work. We both love meeting new people and opening up our home to fun folks who need a short-term place to stay in Austin. We live a pretty communal lifestyle and are used to sharing our living space with other people.",

We offer a home-y environment, not a pristine hotel. If anything is not working properly, we will do our best to get it taken care of. We both work full time so on-site response time may not be immediate! We ask that you not smoke on the property, but do let us know if you need anything.

I grew up in South Carolina, spent a year studying in Innsbruck, Austria and graduated from the University of Notre Dame, before making my way to the warmer climate of Austin. We have 2 sons, ages 12 and 14. They are sweet, athletic boys who spend much of their time at the basketball courts and park across the street. Austin has been my home for 23 years and I love every single thing about it-the celebration of eccentricities, the live music, the vibrancy and activism, the weather and the fabulous people that make it such a special and unique town.",

For being so close to the city, our house is situated on the edge of Austin proper. The house is flooded with natural light in the day and the neighborhood is quiet at night. We are fine artists and the walls throughout are adorned with work from our previous years. Come enjoy a hidden slice of the country within the city limits! You are welcome to sit in the office when you need to take care of work, and we hope you enjoy the sunroom when you are kicking up your feet. We ask that you keep the garage doors closed and come in and out of the front door - as the garage is an active studio space. We may take a hike and head to New Orleans for SXSW - our family members will likely greet you if we are on the road.",
